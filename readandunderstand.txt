ok now lets clear you how i wanted the project to work so that you understand the full logic and idea and add if something missing in our current project or update it and make my prjoect work like that.


i want a college to be first register and when it get register like specific (username) so their should be a page in landing home page of our web which shows get started and from there one can sign in like there will just ask for "college username" and when one enter thier college user name it means he enter to the specific college database than their should apear two buttons login as a admin/teacher and login as student.

login as admin after auth will get their teacher-admin dashboard, the admin/teacher dashboard will have to look like this; their will be categories like classes (class 1st, class2nd) and each class category will contain its student data like students record, their tests/exam according to subjects, also record of student regarding specific subject like (physics, math, urdu), awardlists(all student exam data marks list) and upcoming events/exam. in tacher/admin panel teacher can manage each and everything like making test/exam for specific class of students, add or remove student, update subject (marks, exam list,  upcoming events, awardlist and all other about college the teacher will create student by student id (or roll no) which take them their names, and password which specific student will use to login as student also the teacher can see the students as he created  in specific class like class1st and can update their record which will show them in their student dashboard.
remember teacher will creat the student with their roll and password which stuend will use to login as student all the student record can be updated by techer/admin and there is no specific teacher for specific subject like every teacher can login to the college admin/teacher dashboard and do what he wants to do like make test/exam or update info. 

whereas the login as student will ask for "student id(or roll no)" and password which was generated by teacher/admin and they will get to their student dashboard and student dashboard will contain his records according to subject, awardlist,subject special catagories (physics, math, urdu)  upcoming events(e.g: tests/exam, assignment) and when there is test the test will have specific time and the marks should me added to their record, also the student can see all marks in his subject(physic, math, urdu) if they give sub specific test/exame. also student can edit their data of acc like name, father-name and profile pic and change password.

but the more specific and importand feature in our project is the exam like our project is based in the idea of exam or test teacher can make exam/test of specific subject for specific class of student like when teacher makes the mcques test so their teacher should mark the correct on also so that computer compute the result on realtime and show the result to the student on screen as just after they finish the test. and student will attempt the exam/test with full security feature on their mobiles like their tabs will get lock as the student click or start exam/test for the specific duration of time and the result will store to the student data.
