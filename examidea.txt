let me clear you my idea that how i want the full exam system and colleg-admin and student panel so that you make my project completely working like that;
i want the teacher to creat the exam of whatever subject he wants and whatever of choice he want like (multiple choice q with mark the correct answere so that computer can caluculate result according the correct one, short answere, true/false with mark the correct answere so that computer can caluculate result according the correct one, essay) and questions with time etc (already implemented) so when he select all these and click on creat exam which opens the exam creation and bulk question entries so when he creat succesfully then he will click finish and publish and when the exam publish succesfully ans teacher wants to start the exam now so he will click on the start exam button this will live that specific test/exam on the student panel where student will now able to attempt the test/exam but every student panel has its own choice like when a student click on start the exam the timer of the tes/exam will start for that student and he will attempt the test and exam with all the security feature like during the exam the tab will lock and all the cheating will lock as implemented in our project search and find it and connect or link with it here, as he attempt succesfully and click on submit sand the tab lock the security feature etc will deacrivate and the computer will atomatically show result of his multiple choice question and true/false how much he correct and how much marks he got and then his result will store to his database  and his performance also the computer will make the over-all class awardlist of that specific class and subject and this awardlist will store in the college-admin dashboard and also the awardlist if teacher want that awardlist can share to all students dashboard.
i think most of this work is already implemented in our project search for it and find it link it or connect it with the work i want like the college-admin and student panel or rewrite and add those files and code to the college-admin and student panel as i want everything connected to them .

if the code related to my idea already implemented in our project you have to edit/rewrite/update or remove the part of the code where it need to be becouse these codes are written by my frnd and he made alot of errors and bugs and he write without knowing and understanding the other code so you have to work again and remove the old code 
make your plane and work according to that plane.
