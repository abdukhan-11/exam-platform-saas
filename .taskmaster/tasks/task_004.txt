# Title: Create Landing Page and College Onboarding Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build responsive landing page with college signup and tenant routing functionality
# Details:
Create landing page with two CTAs: 'Sign up' for new colleges and 'Get Started' for existing ones. Implement college registration form collecting college details and unique college_username with real-time availability checking. Build college selection flow that validates college_username and presents login options (Admin/Teacher vs Student). Use shadcn/ui components for consistent design.
