# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Authentication with NextAuth.js and RBAC
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the authentication system using NextAuth.js with JWT and refresh tokens. Configure role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
# Details:
1. Install NextAuth.js and configure it with a JWT strategy.
2. Implement authentication routes for login, registration, and logout.
3. Define user roles (super_admin, college_admin, teacher, student) in the database.
4. Implement middleware to protect routes based on user roles.
5. Store user roles in the JWT for authorization.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that users can register, login, and logout successfully. Ensure that role-based access control is working correctly. Test different user roles and verify that they have access to the appropriate routes and resources.
