		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Next.js Project with Core Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js project initialization into specific configuration steps: project creation, dependency installation, folder structure setup, configuration files, and initial component creation.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to multiple technology integrations (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma, NextAuth, Socket.io, Cloudinary). Requires careful configuration of each tool and ensuring compatibility between versions. Foundation task that affects entire project structure."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Database Schema with Prisma",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Already has 6 subtasks defined. The complexity involves designing multi-tenant architecture with proper relationships, indexes, and row-level security.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multi-tenant architecture requirements, complex entity relationships, performance considerations with indexing, and data isolation requirements. Critical foundation component that affects all data operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Landing Page and College Onboarding Flow",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Already has 4 subtasks defined. The task involves UI/UX design, form validation, and routing logic for tenant selection.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving responsive design, form validation, real-time username checking, and routing logic. Requires good UX design and proper error handling but is primarily frontend work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build Student Dashboard and Profile Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Already has 5 subtasks defined. The task involves creating comprehensive student interface with data visualization and profile management.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to multiple dashboard components, data visualization requirements, profile management with file uploads, and ensuring proper data access controls. Requires integration with multiple backend systems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Secure Exam Taking Interface with Anti-Cheating",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Already has 7 subtasks defined. This is a high-complexity task involving security measures, real-time monitoring, and browser control.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to security requirements, browser API manipulation, real-time monitoring implementation, cross-browser compatibility challenges, and the critical nature of preventing cheating in an exam system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Results System and Award List Generation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Already has 6 subtasks defined. The task involves complex calculation logic, ranking algorithms, and tie-breaker implementations.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to mathematical calculations, ranking algorithms, tie-breaker logic implementation, and the need for accurate and fair result processing. Critical for the core functionality of the exam system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Build Real-time Monitoring and Analytics Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Already has 6 subtasks defined. The task involves real-time data processing, analytics calculations, and dashboard visualization.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to real-time data processing with Socket.io, complex analytics calculations, data visualization requirements, export functionality, and performance considerations for handling multiple concurrent users."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Security Hardening and Performance Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Already has 8 subtasks defined. This is a comprehensive security and performance task covering multiple critical areas.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity covering multiple critical areas: security hardening, input validation, performance optimization, caching implementation, monitoring setup, and backup systems. Requires deep knowledge of security best practices and performance optimization techniques."
