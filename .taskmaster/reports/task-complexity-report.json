      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the subtasks for 'Develop College Admin/Teacher Dashboard' to include specific tasks for UI/UX design for each role (Super Admin, College Admin, Teacher), API integration for each entity (students, subjects, exams), data validation, error handling, and thorough testing for each role and functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple roles, UI elements, and data management, making it complex. The existing subtasks are granular, but more detail on UI/UX, API integration, validation, error handling, and testing is needed."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the subtasks for 'Develop Student Exam Taking Interface with Security Features' to detail specific security measures like browser lock implementation, keyboard shortcut prevention, copy/paste disabling, and anti-tampering techniques. Also, include subtasks for timer accuracy testing and auto-submission reliability.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the security features and real-time requirements. More subtasks are needed to address the intricacies of each security measure and ensure reliable timer and auto-submission functionality."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the subtasks for 'Implement Exam Creation Interface' to include detailed tasks for question bank implementation (MCQ, true/false, essay), timer configuration, exam settings (e.g., shuffling questions, showing results), data validation rules, and UI testing for different question types and exam configurations.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves UI development, data management, and validation. More subtasks are needed to cover the different question types, exam settings, and validation rules."
