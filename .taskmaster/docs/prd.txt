# Overview  
We are building a comprehensive multi-tenant exam SaaS platform that digitizes and secures the examination process for educational institutions. The platform solves the critical problem of conducting fair, secure, and instantly graded online examinations while providing complete administrative control to educational institutions. 

Our target users include colleges, schools, and educational institutions that need a reliable, anti-cheating exam system with instant results, student management, and subscription-based access control. The platform provides value by eliminating manual exam processes, preventing cheating through advanced monitoring, and offering immediate result generation with detailed analytics.

# Core Features  

## Landing, Sign-up, and College Username Flow
What it does: Streamlined onboarding and tenant routing using a unique college username
Why it's important: Ensures clean isolation per institution and a simple entry point for users
How it works:
- Landing page shows two primary CTAs: Sign up (for new colleges) and Get Started (for existing colleges)
- College Sign-up collects college details and a unique `college_username` (e.g., "greenfield_college"), then provisions tenant defaults in a single shared database
- Get Started prompts for `college_username`
  - If invalid, show helpful error and a link back to Sign up
  - If valid, resolve `collegeId` and store it in session for row-level scoping
- After selecting a valid `college_username`, show two options:
  - Login as Admin/Teacher
  - Login as Student

Authentication modes:
- Admin/Teacher: Email/password (or invited account) within the selected college context
- Student: Roll No (student_id) + password issued by teacher/admin, scoped to the selected college

Session isolation:
- All subsequent operations are performed within the selected college context (row-level scoping by `collegeId`) for the remainder of the session

## Super Admin Panel (Platform Owner)
**What it does:** Complete control over all colleges, subscriptions, and platform-wide analytics
**Why it's important:** Enables monetization, quality control, and centralized management of the entire SaaS platform
**How it works:** Web-based dashboard with college CRUD operations, subscription management (free/paid/custom pricing), user analytics across all institutions, and the ability to ban/unban colleges

## College Admin/Teacher Panel  
**What it does:** Institution-level management of students, exams, subjects, and results within their college boundary
**Why it's important:** Provides educational institutions with complete autonomy over their examination processes while maintaining data isolation
**How it works:** Role-based access control allowing teachers to:
- Create/edit exams (per class and subject), set timers/schedules
- Manage classes (e.g., Class 1, Class 2, ...)
- Add/remove students, assign them to classes (enrollments)
- Create student accounts with Roll No and temporary password
- Manage subjects per class (e.g., Physics, Math, Urdu)
- Update results/marks and view award lists per class and subject
- Maintain upcoming events/exams per class and subject
- View institution-only analytics and activity logs
 
### Teacher Class Management Workflow
- Teachers are assigned to one or more classes
- Teachers can create subjects scoped to specific classes
- Teachers can view all students enrolled in their assigned classes
- Teachers can generate award lists per exam, per subject (overall), and per class (overall)

## Student Panel with Anti-Cheating
**What it does:** Secure exam-taking interface with real-time monitoring and instant result delivery
**Why it's important:** Ensures exam integrity while providing immediate feedback to students
**How it works:**
- College selection via `college_username` precedes login
- Student login with Roll No + password issued by teacher/admin
- Student dashboard includes:
  - Subject-wise marks (e.g., Physics 85%, Math 92%, Urdu 78%)
  - Class award list/ranking (e.g., Position 5th out of 30)
  - Upcoming exams (e.g., Math Test – Tomorrow 2PM)
  - Recent exam results
  - Profile management (Edit name, father name, photo, password)
- Exam flow: locked browser, tab-switch prevention, randomized questions, timer, auto-submit
- Post-exam: immediate result display and per-subject history of marks
- Profile management: student can edit name, father-name, profile picture, and change password

## Multi-Tenant Data Architecture (Single Database with Row-Level Isolation)
**What it does:** Strong data isolation using a single shared database with `collegeId` foreign keys and strict row-level scoping
**Why it's important:** Simpler operations and lower complexity while maintaining privacy, security, and scalability
**How it works:**
- Single PostgreSQL database contains all tenant data
- `College` registry stores `college_username`, subscription tier, and status
- Every tenant-scoped table includes a `collegeId` foreign key
- Middleware and queries always scope by `collegeId` from the active session (set after College Username validation)
- Role-based access is enforced within the selected college context only

## Real-time Exam Monitoring
**What it does:** Live tracking of student behavior during examinations with cheating detection
**Why it's important:** Maintains exam integrity and provides evidence of fair testing
**How it works:** JavaScript-based monitoring for tab switches, copy/paste attempts, keyboard shortcuts, with detailed logging and immediate alerts to administrators

## Data Models
```
Single DB (row-level isolation via collegeId)
SuperAdmin → manages → College (1:many)
College → has → college_username (unique), subscription/configs

CollegeContext (scoped by collegeId on each entity)
  ├── User (roles: COLLEGE_ADMIN, TEACHER, STUDENT)
  │    └── StudentProfile (userId 1:1; rollNo unique per college; fatherName; profileImageUrl)
  ├── Class (e.g., Class 1, Class 2)
  │    ├── Enrollment (many:many between Student(User) and Class)
  │    └── TeacherClassAssignment (teacherId ↔ classId linkage)
  ├── Subject (scoped to Class and College)
  │    └── Exam (per Subject and optionally per Class; timer, schedule)
  │         ├── Question (1:many) → QuestionOption (1:many for MCQs)
  │         └── StudentExamAttempt (Student attempts Exam) → StudentAnswer
  ├── Award Lists (computed views or snapshot tables for rankings per exam/subject/class)
  └── Event (upcoming exams/assignments per class/subject)
```

Additional Entity Attributes (implementation-oriented)
- User/Student:
  - Roll number generation: YYYY-XXX per college (e.g., 2025-001)
  - Default password policy: teacher-specified or name+"123" (overrideable at first login)
- Class:
  - classTeacherId (primary teacher), academicYear (e.g., "2024-2025")
- Subject:
  - teacherId (assigned teacher), optional code (e.g., PHY101), optional totalMarks
- Exam:
  - allowLateSubmission (boolean), questionsRandomized (boolean)
- Question:
  - order (int), optional questionImage
- StudentExamAttempt:
  - timeSpent (minutes), grade (e.g., "A+", "A"), cheatingFlags[]
- StudentAnswer:
  - timeSpent (seconds per question)

Award List Generation Logic
- Types and scopes:
  - EXAM_SPECIFIC: rank students by obtained marks for a single exam
  - SUBJECT_CUMULATIVE: aggregate/average across all exams in a subject (term/range)
  - CLASS_OVERALL: weighted/average across all subjects (term/range)
- Tie-breakers:
  - Higher total marks → most recent exam performance → earliest completion time → roll number (ascending)
- Grade boundaries (defaults, configurable):
  - A+ (90–100%), A (80–89%), B+ (70–79%), B (60–69%), C (50–59%), F (<50%)
- Display rules:
  - Show top 10 on dashboards; full lists available on demand
- Update triggers:
  - On submission/result change (event-driven), plus nightly recompute for aggregates

2. **Authentication System** - Required before any user-specific functionality
3. **Role-Based Access Control** - Essential for multi-tenant security
4. **Basic UI Framework** - Needed for all subsequent frontend development

## Fastest Path to Usable Frontend
1. **Static Landing Page** - Immediate visual progress (Day 1)
2. **Login/Register Flow** - First interactive functionality (Day 2-3)
3. **Dashboard Templates** - Visual structure for all user roles (Day 4-5)
4. **Basic CRUD Operations** - Create/view colleges, users, subjects (Week 1)

## Feature Atomicity and Buildability
- **Exam Creation** depends on Subject Management and User Authentication
- **Exam Taking** depends on Exam Creation and Security Features
- **Results System** depends on Exam Taking and Answer Storage
- **Analytics** depends on Results System and Historical Data
- **Payment System** depends on College Management and User Analytics

## Progressive Enhancement Strategy
- Start with basic MCQ exams → Add written questions later
- Begin with manual grading → Implement auto-grading features
- Launch with basic security → Enhanced anti-cheating measures
- Simple analytics first → Advanced reporting and insights
